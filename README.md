Code of my son Peter ISAKOV

This a first experiment of creating Python mobile app with kivy 
It is a simple school calculator tool to help check anwsers of long mathematical expressions like
1 + 122/2 - (123+345)/2 + log(1000)*6 - 2**2

it can also tell you weather your expression is True or False: 199 >=155 or something like  1235=(1200+35)

and it also knows how to solve simple euations type 2x+6 = 10 with one unknown variable...
So, it's useful and a bit of fun :)

**HOW TO USE**


1. Instal Python 3.x
2. run command: pip install kivy

-- download code and logo file --

3. From the directory with the py and png files : run command python easymath.py

ENJOY!
